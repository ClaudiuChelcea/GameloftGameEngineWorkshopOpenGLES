Semester long workshop about creating a game engine and then a game using the game engine created held by Gameloft.

Topics:
* 3D Engine
* Advanced Debugging
* Design Patterns
* Memory management
* Shaders
* Cool Effects
* Rendering Techniques
And many more….

Shader aspects:
– adding models with textures inside a scene;
– using geometric transformations to scale and move the objects inside the scene and to implement a camera;
– implementing trajectories for the scene objects;
– creating a terrain. Mixing textures using a blend map. Using a height map;
– adding a skybox;
– skybox reflection;
– fog effect;
– using lights (Phong model);
– normal mapping;
– creating an animated fire using a displacement map;
– text rendering;
– collisions;
– adding sounds corresponding to different events inside the game;
– using framebuffers for post-processing effects: changing the scene to grayscale, adding blur and bloom effects;
– and some other (optional but cool) effects, for those that finish the project earlier.

Secondary aspects:
– you will learn how to work with Visual Studio and use its features and shortcuts and also how to use a Visual Studio plugin;
– several debugging techniques;
– an introduction to design patterns (we will use the singleton and factory designs);
– memory management;
– writing an XML file. Using a C++ library to read from an XML file.

Programming languages used: C++ and GLSL (shading language).

Libraries used: OpenGL ES 2.0.
